 * @class           module:azure-iot-device.deviceMethod.DeviceMethodResponse
 * @classdesc       `DeviceMethodResponse` provides functionality that allows
 *                  a device method implementation to construct and send a
 *                  response back to the service for a device method call. An
 *                  instance of this class is passed as the second parameter
 *                  to the callback registered via the
 *                  {@link module:azure-iot-device.Client#onDeviceMethod} method.
 *                  method.
 * @param {String}  requestId         The request identifier supplied by the
 *                                    service for this device method call.
 * @param {Object}  transport         An object that implements the interface
 *                                    expected of a transport object, e.g.,
 *                                    {@link module:azure-iot-device~Http|Http}.
