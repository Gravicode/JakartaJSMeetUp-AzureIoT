* put chai setup in a common fixture instead of duplicating it in every test file
* test that onErrorReceived function in EventHubReceiver constructor is only called once in response to an 'errorReceived' event
* client#open/close tests don't really confirm that the connection is opened or closed...
* split out integration tests from unit tests
